The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\\n\\n\",\n",

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\\n\\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle\\'s properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\\n\\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\\n\\n',\n",

The first tip is to always follow the car seat manufacturer's instructions carefully. Each seat is designed with specific installation methods, and adhering to these guidelines ensures that your child is as secure as possible. It's also important to check that the seat is installed at the correct angle; too upright or too flat can be dangerous. Many car seats come with an adjustable base or a built-in angle indicator to help you achieve the right position.\\n\\n\\nAnother crucial tip is to ensure that the car seat is properly anchored to the vehicle. This means using either the seat belt or the LATCH system (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) correctly. The LATCH system is often easier to use and can provide a more secure fit, but it's essential to check that the anchors are not damaged and that they are located in the designated spots in your car. If you're using the seat belt, make sure it's tightened and that the car seat does not move more than an inch side-to-side or front-to-back.\\n\\n\\nFor moms who are new to car seat installation, it can be helpful to have a second set of eyes. Friends, family members, or even a certified child passenger safety technician can assist in checking the installation. They can provide valuable feedback and ensure that everything is set up correctly. Remember, it's better to double-check and be confident in the installation than to rush and potentially compromise your child's safety.\\n\\n\\nelm. In addition to these tips, it's also wise to keep your car seat in good condition. Regularly inspect the seat for any signs of wear and tear, such as cracks or frayed straps. If you've been involved in a car accident, even if the car seat appears undamaged, it's recommended to replace it. Car seats have expiration dates, usually around six years from the date of manufacture, and they can degrade over time. By following these tips and maintaining your car seat, you can help ensure that your child is as safe as possible while traveling in your vehicle.\", token_ids=[1932, 372, 5304, 304, 15476, 263, 1559, 12949, 363, 596, 2217, 697, 29892, 15332, 338, 1828, 792, 29889, 450, 937, 6872, 338, 304, 2337, 1101, 278, 1559, 12949, 12012, 9945, 29915, 29879, 11994, 16112, 29889, 7806, 12949, 338, 8688, 411, 2702, 11161, 3519, 29892, 322, 594, 2276, 292, 304, 1438, 1410, 10652, 1475, 5662, 1973, 393, 596, 2278, 338, 408, 11592, 408, 1950, 29889, 739, 29915, 29879, 884, 4100, 304, 1423, 393, 278, 12949, 338, 5130, 472, 278, 1959, 10696, 29936, 2086, 318, 558, 523, 470, 2086, 12151, 508, 367, 18215, 29889, 9267, 1559, 22091, 2041, 411, 385, 10365, 519, 2967, 470, 263, 4240, 29899, 262, 10696, 27717, 304, 1371, 366, 6176, 278, 1492, 2602, 29889, 13, 13, 13, 2744, 1228, 7618, 1455, 6872, 338, 304, 9801, 393, 278, 1559, 12949, 338, 6284, 23791, 4395, 304, 278, 19716, 29889, 910, 2794, 773, 2845, 278, 12949, 1339, 29873, 470, 278, 365, 14789, 1788, 313, 19357, 530, 305, 943, 322, 323, 621, 414, 363, 20986, 29897, 5149, 29889, 450, 365, 14789, 1788, 338, 4049, 6775, 304, 671, 322, 508, 3867, 263, 901, 11592, 6216, 29892, 541, 372, 29915, 29879, 18853, 304, 1423, 393, 278, 23791, 943, 526, 451, 5625, 4063, 322, 393, 896, 526, 5982, 297, 278, 25373, 805, 1862, 297, 596, 1559, 29889, 960, 366, 29915, 276, 773, 278, 12949, 1339, 29873, 29892, 1207, 1854, 372, 29915, 29879, 19932, 6419, 322, 393, 278, 1559, 12949, 947, 451, 4337, 901, 1135, 385, 297, 305, 2625, 29899, 517, 29899, 2975, 470, 4565, 29899, 517, 29899, 1627, 29889, 13, 13, 13, 2831, 286, 4835, 1058, 526, 716, 304, 1559, 12949, 11161, 29892, 372, 508, 367, 8444, 304, 505, 263, 1473, 731, 310, 5076, 29889, 11169, 1975, 29892, 3942, 5144, 29892, 470, 1584, 263, 2284, 2164, 2278, 28507, 15332, 5722, 8910, 508, 6985, 297, 8454, 278, 11161, 29889, 2688, 508, 3867, 21114, 16705, 322, 9801, 393, 4129, 338, 731, 701, 5149, 29889, 22738, 29892, 372, 29915, 29879, 2253, 304, 3765, 29899, 3198, 322, 367, 24332, 297, 278, 11161, 1135, 304, 364, 1878, 322, 19998, 19632, 895, 596, 2278, 29915, 29879, 15332, 29889, 13, 13, 13, 16422, 29889, 512, 6124, 304, 1438, 25562, 29892, 372, 29915, 29879, 884, 19396, 304, 3013, 596, 1559, 12949, 297, 1781, 4195, 29889, 2169, 1070, 368, 16096, 278, 12949, 363, 738, 18906, 310, 19531, 322, 734, 279, 29892, 1316, 408, 12220, 4684, 470, 285, 25724, 5312, 567, 29889, 960, 366, 29915, 345, 1063, 9701, 297, 263, 1559, 11423, 29892, 1584, 565, 278, 1559, 12949, 5692, 563, 314, 4063, 29892, 372, 29915, 29879, 13622, 304, 5191, 372, 29889, 1704, 22091, 505, 1518, 12232, 10116, 29892, 5491, 2820, 4832, 2440, 515, 278, 2635, 310, 12012, 545, 29892, 322, 896, 508, 3587, 15464, 975, 931, 29889, 2648, 1494, 1438, 25562, 322, 7344, 292, 596, 1559, 12949, 29892, 366, 508, 1371, 9801, 393, 596, 2278, 338, 408, 9109, 408, 1950, 1550, 9850, 292, 297, 596, 19716, 29889, 32007], cumulative_logprob=-218.19815873457304, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=32007)], finished=True, metrics=RequestMetrics(arrival_time=1725469352.0389214, last_token_time=1725469352.0389214, first_scheduled_time=1725469352.0454297, first_token_time=1725469352.092698, time_in_queue=0.006508350372314453, finished_time=1725469359.5257697), lora_request=None))"
